# Improgramming Project

Welcome to the **Improgramming Project**! This project is an innovative approach to programming where code is written and executed live, often in front of an audience, based on open-source tools and audience suggestions.

## Overview

The Improgramming Project combines elements of performance art with software development, creating a dynamic and interactive environment. This project is particularly focused on **RPGLE (Report Program Generator Language Enhanced)**, a high-level programming language used primarily on IBM i systems.

## Key Features

- **Live Coding Sessions**: Programmers write and modify code in real-time, responding to audience ideas and feedback. This makes the sessions highly interactive and engaging.
- **Open Source Collaboration**: The project leverages open-source tools and libraries, allowing for community contributions and continuous improvement.
- **Audience Engagement**: The audience plays a crucial role by providing suggestions and feedback, which are incorporated into the live coding sessions. This fosters a sense of inclusivity and innovation.
